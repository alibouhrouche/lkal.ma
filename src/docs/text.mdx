<Image

    alt="Text Component"
/>

This component has two working modes:
1. As a text input (if it doesn't have placeholders)
2. As a template (if it contains placeholders)

If an unnamed input is present it's output is used as the value.

Examples:

<Image
    src={textExample}
    alt="Text Component Example"
/>
